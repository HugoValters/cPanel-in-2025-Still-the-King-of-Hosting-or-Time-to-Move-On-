## My First Encounter With cPanel
When I first started managing websites, cPanel was everywhere. Shared hosting providers? cPanel. Budget VPS providers? cPanel. Even some premium managed hosting companies used it.
At the time, I thought: “_This must be the industry standard — if everyone uses it, it has to be the best._”

And for a while, it really felt like that. The interface was straightforward, adding domains took seconds, email accounts were a click away, and databases were simple to set up.

But then I discovered **Plesk** — and my view shifted.
Where cPanel felt functional, Plesk felt modern and integrated. Still, cPanel has some undeniable strengths that make it one of the longest-surviving and most widely adopted hosting control panels today.

## What Exactly Is cPanel?
cPanel is a **Linux-based web hosting control panel** that provides a graphical interface and automation tools designed to simplify the process of hosting websites.

It usually comes bundled with **WHM (WebHost Manager)**, which gives administrators and resellers deeper control over accounts and server-level configurations.

In short:
* cPanel = End-user panel (manages domains, websites, emails, files).
* WHM = Admin panel (manages accounts, security, server settings).
Together, they make a powerhouse duo.

## Why People Still Love cPanel in 2025?
Despite newer players like Plesk, DirectAdmin, and cloud-native solutions, cPanel has a loyal user base. Why?
* **Ubiquity** — Almost every hosting provider offers it.
* **Ease of use** — Even beginners can figure it out quickly.
* **Huge ecosystem** — Countless tutorials, forums, and support communities.
* **Mature and stable** — Decades of refinements mean fewer bugs.
* **WHM integration** — Perfect for resellers and agencies to create client accounts.

But… it’s not all sunshine. The **biggest downside today is cost.**

## Pricing in 2025: The Elephant in the Room
Back in the day, hosting providers paid a **flat fee** for unlimited accounts. That changed.

Now cPanel charges **per-account licensing**, which has made many providers (and end-users like us) rethink whether it’s worth it.
* Small VPS (up to 5 accounts) → **$24.95/month**
* Up to 30 accounts → **$39.95/month**
* 100+ accounts → **$59.95+/month**

For agencies, this adds up quickly.
That’s one of the reasons I personally **shifted many of my projects to Plesk**, which often comes bundled cheaper with cloud providers.

## cPanel vs Plesk: My Personal Take
Having worked with both, here’s how I see it:
**cPanel**
* OS Support = Linux only
* WordPress Tools = Basic installers
* UI Design = Outdated but familiar
* Cost = High (per account)
* Developer Features = Limited
* Market Share = Huge

**Plesk**
* OS Support = Linux & Windows
* WordPress Tools = Advanced Toolkit (cloning, staging, security)
* UI Design = Modern and clean
* Cost = More flexible
* Developer Features = Docker, Git, Node.js, PHP versions
* Market Share = Growing fast

**Conclusion:**
* If you need **Linux-only, familiar, widely supported hosting** → cPanel is rock-solid.
* If you want **modern tools, Windows support, and flexibility** → Plesk wins.

## Step-by-Step: Installing cPanel/WHM on a Fresh VPS

> Note: cPanel is commercial software — you need a license. Most hosting providers offer it pre-installed, but if you want to set it up yourself, here’s how:

1. Prepare your VPS (CentOS, AlmaLinux, or CloudLinux recommended)
```
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

2. Update your server
```
yum update -y
```

3. Set hostname (important for installation)
```
hostnamectl set-hostname server.yourdomain.com
```

4. Install cPanel
```
cd /home && curl -o latest -L https://securedownloads.cpanel.net/latest && sh latest
```

5. Access WHM in browser
```
https://your_server_ip:2087
```

Login with root credentials.

6. Activate license
Follow the prompts to activate your cPanel license.

## Pro Tips for cPanel Users
* Use AutoSSL (free certificates via Sectigo) to secure all domains.
Enable **CSF (ConfigServer Security & Firewall)** for better server protection.
* Always keep backups — cPanel integrates with JetBackup and other tools.
* If you manage clients, use **WHM packages** to define limits easily.

## Final Thoughts
cPanel may no longer be the cheapest or most innovative hosting panel, but it’s still the **most familiar and widely adopted**. For many, that alone is worth the cost.

Personally, I now prefer Plesk for its flexibility and modern features, but I still recommend cPanel if:
* You’re on a Linux-only setup.
* You want guaranteed compatibility with hosting providers.
* You value stability and community over cutting-edge tools.
